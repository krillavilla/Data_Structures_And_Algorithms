# Explanation of Trie Implementation

The code provided is an implementation of a Trie, also known as a prefix tree. A Trie is a tree-like data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. 

## Data Structure Choice

The Trie was chosen because of its efficiency in solving certain types of problems. In this case, it's used for efficient word lookup and prefix lookup, which is a common problem in many applications including autocomplete features, spell checkers, and routing tables in networking.

## Efficiency

Tries are incredibly efficient in terms of time complexity. The lookup, insert, and delete operations all run in O(k) time, where k is the length of the key. This is significantly faster than other data structures such as binary search trees, which operate in O(log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the tree.

In terms of space complexity, Tries can be high as they store all the keys separately (as opposed to a hash table, which uses a hash function to save space). However, this space complexity can be improved by using a compressed trie, also known as a radix tree or Patricia tree.

## Code Explanation

The code starts by defining a `TrieNode` class, which represents each node in the Trie. Each node contains a dictionary of its children and a boolean indicating whether it's a complete word.
