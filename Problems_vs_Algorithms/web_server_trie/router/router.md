# Explanation of RouteTrie and Router Implementation

The code provided implements a simple routing mechanism using a Trie data structure. The Trie is a tree-like data structure that stores strings for efficient retrieval. In this case, it is used to store routes and their associated handlers.

## Data Structure Choice

The Trie was chosen as the data structure for this task due to its efficiency in handling and retrieving strings. In the context of routing, each part of the path can be considered as a string. The Trie allows us to efficiently store these parts and retrieve the handler associated with a complete path.

## Efficiency

The time complexity for inserting a new route in the Trie is O(n), where n is the number of parts in the path. This is because we need to traverse through each part of the path to insert it into the Trie.

The time complexity for looking up a route in the Trie is also O(n) for the same reason. We need to traverse through each part of the path to find the associated handler.

The space complexity of the Trie is O(m), where m is the total number of routes inserted into the Trie. Each route is stored as a separate path in the Trie, so the space required grows linearly with the number of routes.

## RouteTrieNode and RouteTrie

The `RouteTrieNode` class represents each node in the Trie. It contains a handler, which is set if the node represents the end of a route, and a dictionary of its children.

The `RouteTrie` class is the actual Trie itself. It has methods for inserting a new route and its associated handler (`insert`), and for finding the handler associated with a route (`find`).

## Router

The `Router` class wraps the `RouteTrie` and handles the actual routing. It provides a simple interface for adding new routes with associated handlers (`add_handler`) and for looking up the handler associated with a route (`lookup`). It also handles splitting the path into its constituent parts (`split_path`).

The `Router` class also handles the case where a route is not found. In this case, it returns a 'not found' handler, which can be set when the `Router` is initialized.
