# Explanation for `sort_012` function

The `sort_012` function is designed to sort an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single traversal. The function uses a counting sort approach, which is a sorting technique based on keys between a specific range. In this case, the keys are 0, 1, and 2.

## Reasoning

The decision to use a counting sort approach is based on the fact that the input array only contains three distinct elements: 0, 1, and 2. This makes it a perfect candidate for counting sort, which is efficient when the range of potential items in the input is small.

## Efficiency

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function traverses the entire array once to count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because the function creates a new array to store the sorted elements. The size of this array is equal to the size of the input array.

# Explanation for `test_function` function

The `test_function` function is used to test the `sort_012` function. It takes a test case as input, sorts it using the `sort_012` function, and then checks if the sorted array is equal to the array obtained by using Python's built-in `sorted` function on the test case.

## Reasoning

The decision to use Python's built-in `sorted` function for comparison is based on the fact that it is a reliable and efficient way to sort an array. If the `sort_012` function is implemented correctly, the sorted array it returns should be equal to the array returned by the `sorted` function.

## Efficiency

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `test_function` function is O(n log n), where n is the length of the test case. This is because the function uses Python's built-in `sorted` function, which has a time complexity of O(n log n).
