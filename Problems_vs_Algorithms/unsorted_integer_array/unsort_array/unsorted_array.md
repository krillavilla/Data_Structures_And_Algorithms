# Explanation for `get_min_max` function

The `get_min_max` function is designed to find the minimum and maximum values in a list of unsorted integers in a single pass, which fulfills the requirement of O(n) time complexity.

## Decision Making

The decision to use a list as the data structure is based on the problem statement itself, which provides a list of unsorted integers. Lists in Python are dynamic and can hold items of any type which makes it suitable for this problem.

The function starts by checking if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`. This is a necessary step to handle edge cases where the input list might be empty.

Next, the function initializes `min_val` and `max_val` with the first element of the list. This is done because we need some initial values for comparison with the rest of the elements in the list.

The function then traverses the list, updating `min_val` and `max_val` whenever it finds a smaller or larger value, respectively. This is the core logic of the function which allows it to find the min and max in a single pass.

Finally, the function returns a tuple with `min_val` and `max_val`. The use of a tuple here is to return multiple values from a function.

## Efficiency

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This is because the function traverses the list only once.

The space complexity of the function is O(1), which means the space taken by the function does not increase with the size of the input list. This is because the function only uses a constant amount of space to store the min and max values and does not create any new data structures that scale with input size.
