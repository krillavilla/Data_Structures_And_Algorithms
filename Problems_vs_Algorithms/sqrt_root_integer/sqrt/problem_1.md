# Explanation for Square Root Calculation

The code provided calculates the floor value of the square root of a given integer. The solution is implemented using a binary search algorithm, which is a decision made due to its efficiency in terms of time complexity.

## Reasoning

The binary search algorithm was chosen because it has a time complexity of O(log(n)), which is efficient for large inputs. This algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, which is much faster than a linear search that would have a time complexity of O(n).

The binary search starts with the whole range of numbers from 1 to the given number. It then finds the middle of this range and checks if the square of this middle number is equal to the given number. If it is, it means we've found the square root and the middle number is returned. If the square of the middle number is less than the given number, the search continues in the upper half of the range (from middle + 1 to end). If the square of the middle number is greater than the given number, the search continues in the lower half of the range (from start to middle - 1).

## Efficiency

The time complexity of this solution is O(log(n)) due to the binary search algorithm. This is because with each iteration, the search space is halved, resulting in a logarithmic number of steps.

The space complexity of the solution is O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of space. This is because the solution only uses a few integer variables and does not depend on the size of the input number.
