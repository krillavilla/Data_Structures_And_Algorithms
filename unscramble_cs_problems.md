# Project: Unscramble Computer Science Problems

## Project Overview
In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

## What will I learn?
In this project, you will:
- Apply your Python knowledge to breakdown problems into their inputs and outputs.
- Perform an efficiency analysis of your solution.
- Warm up your Python skills for the course.

## Why this Project?
You'll apply the skills you've learned so far in a more realistic scenario. The five tasks are structured to give you experience with a variety of programming problems. You will receive code review of your work; this personal feedback will help you to improve your solutions.

## Step 1 - Download the Files
Download and open the zipped folder [here](https://github.com/krillavilla/Data-Security-Analysis-in-Online-Payment-Processing/blob/main/project_submission.md). In the folder, you will find five Python files: `Task0.py`, `Task1.py`, `Task2.py`, `Task3.py`, and `Task4.py`, as well as two CSV files: `calls.csv` and `texts.csv`.

## About the Data
The text and call data are provided in CSV files.

- The text data (`texts.csv`) has the following columns: sending telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), timestamp of text message (string).
- The call data (`calls.csv`) has the following columns: calling telephone number (string), receiving telephone number (string), start timestamp of telephone call (string), duration of telephone call in seconds (string).

All telephone numbers are 10 or 11 numerical digits long. Each telephone number starts with a code indicating the location and/or type of the telephone number. There are three different kinds of telephone numbers, each with a different format:

- **Fixed lines** start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area codes vary in length but always begin with 0. Example: "(022)40840621".
- **Mobile numbers** have no parentheses but have a space in the middle of the number to help readability. The mobile code of a mobile number is its first four digits and they always start with 7, 8, or 9. Example: "93412 66159".
- **Telemarketers' numbers** have no parentheses or space but start with the code 140. Example: "1402316533".

## Step 2 - Implement the Code
Complete the five tasks (`Task0.py`, `Task1.py`, `Task2.py`, `Task3.py`, and `Task4.py`). Do not change the data or instructions, simply add your code below what has been provided. Include all the code that you need for each task in that file.

In Tasks 3 and 4, you can use in-built methods `sorted()` or `list.sort()` for sorting, which are implementations of Timsort and Samplesort, respectively. Both these sorting methods have a worst-case time-complexity of O(n log n). Check the links below to learn more about these methods:
- [How to use the above methods](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html)
- [Complexity analysis of Timsort and Samplesort](http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/listsort.txt)

The solution outputs for each file should be the print statements described in the instructions. Feel free to use other print statements during the development process, but remember to remove them for submissionâ€”the submitted files should print only the solution outputs.

## Step 3 - Calculate Big O
Once you have completed your solution for each problem, perform a run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) of your solution. Document this for each problem and include this in your submission.

## Step 4 - Check again Rubric and Submit
Use the rubric to check your work before submission. A Udacity Reviewer will give feedback on your work based on this rubric and will leave helpful comments on your code.

### Rubric

#### Criteria: Submission Requirements
- **Code Quality**: Your code should be well-structured and readable.
- **Output**: Print only the solution outputs. Feel free to use other print statements during the development process, but remember to remove them for submission.

#### Tasks
- **Task 0 Successful**: The script correctly prints out the information of the first record of texts and the last record of calls.
- **Task 1 Successful**: The script correctly prints the number of distinct telephone numbers in the dataset.
- **Task 2 Successful**: The script correctly prints the telephone number that spent the longest time on the phone and the total time in seconds they spent on phone calls.
- **Task 3 Successful**: The script correctly prints the telephone codes called by fixed-line numbers in Bangalore and the percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore that are to fixed lines in Bangalore.
- **Task 4 Successful**: The script correctly prints the list of numbers that could be telemarketers.

#### Time-Complexity
- Student provides a text file accurately explaining their run time analysis (Worst-Case Big-O Notation) for each solution they produced.
