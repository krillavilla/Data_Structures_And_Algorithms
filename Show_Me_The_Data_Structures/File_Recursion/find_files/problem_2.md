# Explanation for the `find_files` function

## Decision Reasoning

The `find_files` function is designed to find all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with a specific suffix. The function uses recursion, which is a natural fit for this problem because it involves exploring a file system, which is inherently a hierarchical structure.

The function uses the `os` module in Python, which provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality like reading the file system.

The decision to use a list as the data structure to store the file paths was made because lists in Python are dynamic, ordered collections, which means they can easily handle the addition of new elements (file paths in this case), and maintain their order.

## Time Efficiency

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of files and directories in the file system. This is because the function needs to visit every file and directory once to check if it matches the given suffix.

## Space Efficiency

The space complexity of the function is also O(n), where n is the number of directories in the file system. This is because in the worst case, the function could end up storing the path to every file in the file system in the result list. Additionally, due to the recursive nature of the function, the call stack could also grow as deep as the deepest directory structure.
