# Explanation for Huffman Coding Implementation

## Decision Behind Data Structures Used

The main data structure used in this implementation is a priority queue, which is implemented using a heap data structure. The reason for using a priority queue is to efficiently find and remove the node with the smallest frequency, which is a key part of building the Huffman tree.

A heap is a complete binary tree where each node has a value less (in case of a min heap) or more (in case of a max heap) than its children. This property makes it suitable to implement a priority queue where the node with the highest priority (or in this case, the lowest frequency) can be removed in O(1) time.

A dictionary is used to store the frequency of each character in the input data. This allows us to calculate the frequency of each character in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input data.

## Time Efficiency

The time complexity of the Huffman encoding function is dominated by the process of building the Huffman tree. This involves removing two nodes from the priority queue and adding one node back to it until only one node remains. Each of these operations takes O(log n) time, where n is the number of unique characters in the input data. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the Huffman encoding function is O(n log n).

The time complexity of the Huffman decoding function is O(m), where m is the length of the encoded data. This is because we simply iterate over the encoded data and follow the corresponding path in the Huffman tree to decode each character.

## Space Efficiency

The space complexity of the Huffman encoding function is O(n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input data. This is because we need to store a node for each unique character in the priority queue while building the Huffman tree.

The space complexity of the Huffman decoding function is also O(n), where n is the number of unique characters in the input data. This is because we need to store the Huffman tree to decode the encoded data.
