# Explanation for main.py

The problem was to implement the `union` and `intersection` functions for two linked lists.

I chose to use a linked list data structure because it allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations. This is particularly useful for our problem as we need to traverse and modify the lists.

The `union` function works by creating a new linked list and traversing both input lists. For each element in the input lists, it checks if the element is already present in the new list. If it's not, it appends the element to the new list. This ensures that the new list contains all unique elements from both input lists, representing the union of the lists.

The `intersection` function also creates a new linked list. It then traverses the first input list and for each element, it checks if the element is present in the second input list. If it is, it appends the element to the new list. This ensures that the new list contains all elements that are common to both input lists, representing the intersection of the lists.

The time complexity of both the `union` and `intersection` functions is O(n^2) because in the worst case, for each element in the first list, we may have to traverse the entire second list or the new list. This is not the most efficient solution and could be improved by using a data structure with faster lookup times, such as a set or a hash map.

The space complexity of both functions is O(n) because in the worst case, we create a new list that contains all elements from both input lists. This occurs when all elements are unique in the case of the `union` function, or when all elements are common in the case of the `intersection` function.ction` function is... because...
