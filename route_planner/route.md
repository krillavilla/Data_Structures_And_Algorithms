# Explanation of `student_code.py`

The `student_code.py` file contains an implementation of the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. The A* algorithm is a popular choice for pathfinding due to its efficiency and accuracy.

## Choice of Algorithm

The A* algorithm was chosen because it is an informed search algorithm, meaning it uses heuristic information to guide its search. This makes it more efficient than uninformed search algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm when the heuristic is well-chosen.

## Data Structures

The algorithm uses several data structures to keep track of information during the search:

- A priority queue (`open_list`) is used to store the nodes that have been discovered but not yet evaluated. The priority of a node is determined by its `f` value, which is the sum of the cost to reach the node (`g`) and the estimated cost from the node to the goal (`h`). Using a priority queue allows the algorithm to quickly find the node with the lowest `f` value, which is the next node to be evaluated.

- Three dictionaries (`g_values`, `h_values`, and `f_values`) are used to store the `g`, `h`, and `f` values of the nodes. Using dictionaries allows the algorithm to quickly look up these values.

- Another dictionary (`came_from`) is used to keep track of the path from the start node to each node. This is used to reconstruct the path once the goal is found.

## Efficiency

The efficiency of the A* algorithm comes from its use of heuristic information to guide its search. By prioritizing nodes that are estimated to be closer to the goal, the algorithm can often find the shortest path without evaluating all nodes.

The use of appropriate data structures also contributes to the efficiency of the algorithm. In particular, using a priority queue for the open list and dictionaries for the `g`, `h`, and `f` values allows these operations to be performed in O(log n) and O(1) time, respectively.
