## Overview
The Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program helps learners excel at solving well-defined problems, such as calculating the efficiency of a specific algorithm, to more open-ended problems like building a private blockchain or writing a web crawler. The program includes solving over 80 practice problems, learning to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms, and implementing solutions based on design choices.
