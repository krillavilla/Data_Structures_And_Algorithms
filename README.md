## Overview
The Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program helps learners excel at solving well-defined problems, such as calculating the efficiency of a specific algorithm, to more open-ended problems like building a private blockchain or writing a web crawler. The program includes solving over 80 practice problems, learning to evaluate and assess different data structures and algorithms, and implementing solutions based on design choices.

- **Lesson 2: Python Refresher**
- **Lesson 3: How to Solve Problems**
- **Lesson 4: Big Notation**

**Course Project**: [Unscramble Computer Science Problems](unscramble_cs_problems.md)

**My Experience with Unscramble Computer Science Problems Project**

I worked on the Unscramble Computer Science Problems project and received positive feedback for using efficient data structures in Python. However, I struggled with the time complexity for Task 3, which required a linear time solution. After extensive research, I successfully implemented an algorithm that met the linear time complexity requirement. This experience reinforced my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of algorithmic efficiency. Thanks to the valuable feedback and guidance I received, I am now more confident in my ability to analyze and optimize code. See screenshots below
